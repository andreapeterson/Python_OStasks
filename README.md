# Python_OStasks
Using Python scripts to do some OS commands. I executed these scripts on a Vagrant Ubuntu box. 

'checkfile.py' lets you check if a certain directory or file path exists. 'ostasks.py' allows you to add user(s), add a group, and the option to add those users to any group. These are very super simple commands, I am just getting the hang of Python + Linux together before delving into Ansible!
